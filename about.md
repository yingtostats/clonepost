<p>The life I want, there is no shorcuts. - Jenny <i>An Education</i> </p>
</blockquote>
</font>


I am a forth-year undergraduate at [Renmin University of China](http://www.ruc.edu.cn/) majoring in Statistics. I studied at [UC Davis](http://www.ucdavis.edu) as an exchange student for my third year during 2015 - 2016. I am from Xiamen, Fujian, China. I love NBA especially Los Angeles Lakers. I am a died-hard Kobe's fan. If you asked me what my dream was before 2015, I would say to watch a victory of Lakers in Staples Center led by Kobe Bryant ranked first in my top to-do list. My dream came true when I was in Los Angeles [2015-12-15 Los Angeles Lakers vs Milwaukee Bukcs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPjBV70-TzE). I also love traveling and cooking in spare time. I hope I could love reading but I am still struggling against my drowsy head while holding a book. I believe in diligence, you can read the stories of me about [Why diligence](http://yingsight.com/tags/#Diligence).
