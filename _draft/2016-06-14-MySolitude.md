I started to forget about the day and night. I am confused with the dream and reality. I am struggling to figure out the real life and my true feeling. <br>

Just follow your heart is never enough to make up your mind, cause your heart is so unpredictable.  All the words I've said is from the bottom of my heart, for that moment.

I would keep all the good memories since it's really hard to forget that happiness.

"Welcome to the real world. It sucks. But you're gonna love it."
