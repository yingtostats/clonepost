If I only have one choice of the most important person in my childhood, I would say it's my grandpa definitely. My parents are architecture engineers and they settled down in Xiamen, a city of island famous as a tourist city. They seemed always occupied with works in my memory. So since I was born, my grandpa took care of my daily life till I went to college, that is 19 years. <br>

He left our hometown, a small village where he lived for years, to Xiamen, a quite modern city for my better education. He worked as a tailor when he was young. He didn't receive a lot education due to history reason. But he is a very good educator in my life. I learnt how to respect, to love and the importance of justice and integrity in one's life. One thing he told me the most is to work hard for the life I want. He told me to learn to be a diligent person as best I can when I was just a little kid in kindergarten with only half of his height.

Honestly, I am definitely not a smart kid when I was young. The moment I realized is my first year of high school. At that time, I put a lot of work in preparing Olympic Maths Competition. I took special classes after regular school time with other students who also like math offered by our math teachers every day. However, I am the only one among them who didn't get any awards even in our-school-wide... Even those who didn't attend the Olympic class received quite a lot awards... I was very upset though. But thanks my grandpa, he is the person who never praises cleverness, not even a word.

After I grew up, I gradually understood why grandpa only stressed the diligence instead of cleverness to a little kid. We would eventually find out this real world is not the fairy tale we thought when we grow up. But one has to live the life given what he or she has, no matter what. We cannot decide what we have when we were born, but we can always make it better given what we have. Success is conditional; success of one's life is not the comparison with others; success is that we endure and conquer the difficulties to make what we have better.
